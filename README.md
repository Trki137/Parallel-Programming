# Parallel Programming - FER

This repository contains projects from the **Parallel Programming** course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER). These projects demonstrate the application of parallel programming concepts using various tools and libraries.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following directories:

1. **MPI - Dining Philosophers Problem**  
    This project implements the classic Dining Philosophers problem using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). The solution explores synchronization, deadlock prevention, and efficient communication between processes in a parallel environment.

2. **Connect4 with MPI**  
    In this project, the Connect4 game is implemented with a parallelized approach using MPI. The game logic is distributed across multiple processes to improve performance and explore parallel computation strategies.

3. **PyOpenCL**  
    This project utilizes PyOpenCL to demonstrate parallel computing on GPUs. Various computational tasks are implemented to showcase the power of GPU acceleration and the use of OpenCL in Python for high-performance computing.
